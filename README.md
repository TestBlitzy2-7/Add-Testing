# hao-backprop-test
test project for backprop integration.

## Overview

This project is a minimal Node.js HTTP server designed for integration testing with the Backprop platform. The server responds with "Hello, World!" to all HTTP requests and serves as a baseline compatibility validation tool for Node.js applications on AI-focused cloud infrastructure.

## Testing Infrastructure

This project implements comprehensive unit testing using professional-grade testing frameworks to ensure enterprise-level quality assurance and platform compatibility validation.

### Testing Framework

**Primary Framework: Jest (^29.0.0)**
- Zero-configuration test runner with built-in coverage reporting
- Integrated assertion library and mocking capabilities  
- Snapshot testing for response validation
- Built-in coverage analysis without additional tools

**Alternative Framework: Mocha + Chai + Sinon**
- Mocha (^10.0.0): Flexible test runner and suite organization
- Chai (^4.3.0): BDD/TDD assertion library with fluent API
- Sinon (^15.0.0): Comprehensive mocking and stubbing library

**HTTP Testing Utilities:**
- **Supertest (^6.3.0)**: HTTP assertion library for integration testing of Node.js HTTP servers

### Development Setup

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 14.0.0 (required for testing framework compatibility)
- NPM >= 6.0.0 (for proper package-lock.json handling)

#### Installing Testing Dependencies

Install all development dependencies including testing frameworks:

```bash
npm install
```

For production deployment (excludes testing dependencies):

```bash
npm install --production
```

#### Development Dependencies

The following testing dependencies are installed as devDependencies:

```json

  }
}
```

### Test Directory Structure

Tests are organized in a hierarchical structure for maintainability and clarity:

```plaintext

```

### Test Execution Commands

#### Basic Test Execution

Run the complete test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

This executes all unit tests, integration tests, and generates coverage reports.

#### Test Execution Options

**Run tests with coverage:**
```bash
npm run test:coverage
# or with Jest directly:
npx jest --coverage
```

**Run tests in watch mode (development):**
```bash
npm run test:watch
# or with Jest directly:
npx jest --watch
```

**Run tests for CI/CD:**
```bash
npm run test:ci
# or with Jest directly:
npx jest --coverage --ci --watchAll=false
```

**Run specific test files:**
```bash
# Run only unit tests
npx jest test/unit/

# Run only integration tests  
npx jest test/integration/

# Run a specific test file
npx jest test/unit/server.test.js
```

### Test Coverage

#### Coverage Targets

The project maintains strict coverage requirements:

| Coverage Type | Target | Rationale |
|---------------|--------|-----------|
| Line Coverage | ≥ 100% | Achievable due to minimal codebase |
| Function Coverage | ≥ 100% | Single function in server.js |
| Branch Coverage | ≥ 100% | Error-handling paths create conditional branches |
| Statement Coverage | ≥ 100% | Complete code execution validation |

#### Coverage Report Generation

Coverage reports are automatically generated during test execution and available in multiple formats:

**HTML Report (Interactive):**
```bash
npm test
# Open coverage/html/index.html in browser
```

**Terminal Summary:**
Coverage summary appears in terminal after test execution.

**JSON Data:**
Machine-readable coverage data available at `coverage/coverage-final.json`.

**LCOV Format:**
Industry-standard format at `coverage/lcov.info` for external tooling integration.

#### Coverage Configuration

Jest is configured with strict coverage thresholds in `jest.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      lines: 100,
      functions: 100,
      branches: 100,
      statements: 100
    }
  },
  collectCoverageFrom: [
    "server.js"
  ],
  coverageReporters: ["text", "lcov", "html", "json"]
};
```

#### Interpreting Coverage Reports

**Coverage Report Structure:**
- **Lines**: Percentage of executable lines tested
- **Functions**: Percentage of functions called during tests
- **Branches**: Percentage of conditional branches executed
- **Statements**: Percentage of statements executed

**Coverage Threshold Enforcement:**
- Tests fail if any coverage metric falls below 100%
- Pipeline termination occurs before deployment if thresholds not met
- Coverage gates are automatically enforced during CI/CD execution

### Test Categories

#### Unit Tests (`test/unit/server.test.js`)

**Server Initialization Tests:**
- Validate successful port binding to localhost:3000
- Verify console logging of startup status
- Confirm server ready state before accepting connections

**Response Generation Tests:**
- Verify "Hello, World!\n" content consistency across all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS)
- Validate HTTP 200 status code for all valid requests
- Confirm "text/plain" Content-Type header across all methods
- Test response uniformity regardless of request path or parameters

**Header Validation Tests:**
- Verify Content-Type header presence and correct "text/plain" value
- Validate Content-Length header accuracy and consistency  
- Confirm standard HTTP headers compliance

#### Integration Tests (`test/integration/http-server.test.js`)

**End-to-End HTTP Testing:**
- Complete request-response cycle validation
- Server lifecycle management (startup/shutdown)
- Concurrent connection handling validation
- Platform compatibility verification

**Error Handling Tests:**
- Port conflict simulation and error detection
- Network binding failure scenarios
- Server process termination and recovery testing
- Resource cleanup verification

**Edge Case Testing:**
- Malformed HTTP request processing
- Boundary condition testing for request parameters and headers
- Concurrent connection limit testing
- Invalid HTTP method handling

#### Performance Testing

**Performance Validation Thresholds:**
- Server startup time < 100ms
- Response generation time < 10ms per request  
- End-to-end response time < 50ms
- Error detection time < 50ms for port conflicts

### Test Best Practices

#### Test Organization Patterns

**Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) Pattern:**
Each test follows clear structure:
- **Arrange**: Set up test conditions and data
- **Act**: Execute the code being tested
- **Assert**: Verify expected outcomes

**Test Isolation:**
- Each test creates its own server instance
- Proper cleanup in afterEach hooks
- No shared state between tests
- Independent test execution capability

#### Mock Strategies

**Server Lifecycle Mocking:**
- Port conflict simulation through duplicate server instances
- Network interface binding failure scenarios
- Process termination and recovery testing

**Request/Response Mocking:**
- Malformed request simulation for protocol violation testing
- Edge case request generation for boundary condition validation
- Console output capture for startup logging verification

### Continuous Integration

#### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

The testing infrastructure is designed for seamless CI/CD integration:

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Dependency Installation**: `npm ci`
2. **Unit Test Execution**: `npm test`
3. **Coverage Analysis**: Automatic threshold validation
4. **Integration Testing**: Platform compatibility validation
5. **Artifact Publishing**: Coverage reports and test results

**Quality Gates:**
- All tests must pass (100% success rate)
- Coverage thresholds must be met (100% across all metrics)
- Performance benchmarks must be satisfied
- No security vulnerabilities in dependencies

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**Port Binding Errors:**
- Ensure port 3000 is available before running tests
- Check for existing server processes: `lsof -i :3000`
- Kill conflicting processes if necessary

**Test Failures:**
- Review test output for specific assertion failures
- Check coverage reports for uncovered code paths
- Verify server startup and shutdown procedures

**Coverage Issues:**
- Ensure all code paths are tested, including error conditions
- Add tests for missing branches (error handling scenarios)
- Verify test isolation doesn't skip code execution

#### Debug Commands

**Verbose Test Output:**
```bash
npx jest --verbose
```

**Test Debugging:**
```bash
npx jest --detectOpenHandles --forceExit
```

**Coverage Debug:**
```bash
npx jest --coverage --verbose
```
